This is our minimal customized [Alpine Linux](http://alpinelinux.org) base image based on [official Alpine](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/alpine/). Optionally you can enable a cron daemon, to get it running you need to provide the environment variable `CRON_ENABLED=true` or `CRON_ENABLED=1`. You can see the available variables below. Be aware that you have to start `s6` to get the cron daemon started automatically.
